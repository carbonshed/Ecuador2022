This repository serves to host data and analyses used in the research supporting the work in *Water Temperature and Catchment Characteristics Drive Variance in Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Small Ponds in a Peatland-Rich, High-Altitude Tropical Ecosystem*

## Purpose
To provide access to the data and make analyses reproducible for others. All scripts and data files for creating our figures using R statistical software are provided within this repository.
